📊 Predicting Student Exam Results:

🔍 Project Overview

This project explores how simple machine learning techniques can be applied to predict student performance based on study habits and attendance. Using a small dataset, the project demonstrates regression, classification, and clustering methods to uncover insights into the factors that influence academic outcomes.

🎯 Objectives

Linear Regression: Predict a student’s final exam score based on hours studied.

Logistic Regression: Classify whether a student passes or fails using attendance rate and study time.

K-Means Clustering: Group students based on study time and attendance, then analyze the unique characteristics of each group.

📂 Dataset Details

The dataset contains the following columns:

StudentID – Unique identifier for each student

AttendanceRate – Percentage of classes attended

StudyTime – Weekly study hours

FinalExamScore – Final exam score (0–100)

Pass/Fail – Binary outcome (1 = Pass, 0 = Fail)

A sample dataset of about 20–30 records is used to keep the project simple and easy to analyze in Excel, Python, or any programming language.

📘 Expected Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, students will:

Gain hands-on experience with regression, classification, and clustering algorithms.

Learn how to apply machine learning methods to real-world educational data.

Develop the ability to interpret and discuss model outputs effectively.

Understand the role of study time and attendance in predicting academic success.
